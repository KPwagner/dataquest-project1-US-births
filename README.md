# Dataquest Guided Project 1: Explore U.S. Births.
This notebook and two datasets are from the Python Programming: Beginner section of Dataquest's Data Analyst path. The Jupyter Notebook titled "Basics" shows the analysis I performed using these datasets. Since Jupyter Notebooks render as HTML on Github, you can't interact with the Notebook unless you download the files.
