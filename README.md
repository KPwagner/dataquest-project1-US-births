# Dataquest Guided Project 1: Explore U.S. Births.
This project is from the Python Programming: Beginner course of Dataquest's Data Analyst path. The programming and analysis that I performed in the Jupyter Notebook utilizes only basic Python functionality and no external modules. I only used techniques covered throughout this Dataquest course.

## Files
- [US_births.ipynb](https://github.com/KPwagner/dataquest-project1-US-births/blob/master/US_births.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook showing the functions I created to explore the datasets along with examples of usage and a few findings. Since Jupyter Notebooks render as HTML on Github (if they render at all), you can't interact with the Notebook unless you download the files.
- [US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv](https://github.com/KPwagner/dataquest-project1-US-births/blob/master/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv) CSV dataset with data for U.S. births from 1994 to 2003. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
- [US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv](https://github.com/KPwagner/dataquest-project1-US-births/blob/master/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv) CSV dataset with data for U.S. births from 2000 to 2014. Source: United States Social Security Administration.

## Findings from Data Exploration
After combining the CDC and SSA data, the resulting dataset spans all dates from 1994 to 2014.
