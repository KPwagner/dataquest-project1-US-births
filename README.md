# Dataquest Guided Project 1: Explore U.S. Births.
This project is from the Python Programming: Beginner section of Dataquest's Data Analyst path. 

## Files
- [US_births.ipynb](../blob/master/US_births.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook showing the functions I created to explore the datasets along with examples of usage and a few findings. Since Jupyter Notebooks render as HTML on Github, you can't interact with the Notebook unless you download the files.
- [US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv](../blob/master/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv) CSV dataset with data for U.S. births from 1994 to 2003. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
