# Dataquest Guided Project 1: Explore U.S. Births.
This Jupyter Notebook (US_births.ipynb) and two datasets (US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv, US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv) are from the Python Programming: Beginner section of Dataquest's Data Analyst path. The Jupyter Notebook shows the analysis I performed using these datasets. Since Jupyter Notebooks render as HTML on Github, you can't interact with the Notebook unless you download the files.

*__Note:__ this project is very much a work in progress.*
